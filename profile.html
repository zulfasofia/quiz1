    <h1>Hello👋🏻, I'm Zulfa!</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="par">
      <p>Hello, My name is Zulfayanti Sofia Solichin. My Friends usually call me Zulfa. I was born in Bandung on March 28 2001. I have two 
        brothers and one sister.One of my brother have just got his bachelor degree in mathematics. My other brother just got accepted in
        University of Indonesia in Physics major in the undergraduated program. My sister is the youngest, she is still in second year of 
        junior high school.</p>
      <p>Even though i was  born and raised in Bandung city, i'm not really good at Sundanesse because none of my parents are actually
        Sundanesse. My Dad is a pure Javnesse. He was born and raised in Klaten, Central Java. His parents are also Javanesse. My Mom was 
        born and raised in Jakarta, but she is not actually a Jakarta person, her parents are Javanesse. My parents met when they were 
        studying in College in Bandung and decided to have family there too.</p>
      <p>I'm currently on my fifth semester as an Informatics student in Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. Being an informatics student
        has been my dream since I was in junior high school. My Dad was the one who suggest me to join informatics major once i got into
        college because he saw my insterest in logical problems and he once studied that too so he tought it would suit me.</p>
      <p>At first, Studying in Surabaya was pretty hard for me because although it's still on the same island with my hometown, the culture
        was quite different, they even have different local languange that they sometimes accideltally talk to me in that language. Honestly,
        Since i still count as a javanesse descent, i know a litte bit of Javanesse languange but sometime when they talking too fast I found
        it hard to understand what they said. Another thing that makes it felt hard was because it was my first time living alone, away from
        my family and none of my senior high school friends is studying in Surabaya, so sometimes i felt pretty lonely. But thankfully, I met 
        some great friends there, they were so nice and friendly, they were also really understanding with the overseas student like me.</p>
