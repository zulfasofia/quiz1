    <h1>Food Hunting in Bandung</h1>
    <br>

    <div class="par">
      <p>Most of you must have already know some 'aci' type of food like cireng, cilok, and cimol since it's been realy popular these days. Those are some
        example of local food from Bandung. In fact, there are some more local food from Bandung. So, here I'm going to tell you some other food and drink 
        that you should try especially when you visit Bandung.</p>

      <h3>Karedok</h3>
      <p>Karedok is the traditional Indonesian version of a vegetable salad. This simple and healthy dish calls for fresh and raw ingredients which are sliced 
        and served with a traditional peanut sauce. The most common vegetables in karedok include cucumbers, cabbage, green beans, Thai basil, bean sprouts, 
        and eggplant, however, other vegetables can be used as well.<br>
        The sauce is made by grinding fried peanuts together with salt, palm sugar, and chili. The flavor of the sauce can be adjusted with other ingredients
        such as shrimp paste or garlic. Due to the usage of peanut sauce, karedok is often compared with another Indonesian specialty, gado-gado, but it is
        still distinguished by the usage of only raw ingredients.</p>

      <h3>Mie Kocok</h3>
      <p>Hailing from Bandung, mie kocok is an aromatic soup that combines sliced beef, beef offal, or meatballs with flat yellow noodles and other accompaniments
        such as crackers, bean sprouts, sliced scallions, and fried shallots. All ingredients are served in a clear beef broth, while spicy sambal paste and soy
        sauce may be served as condiments.<br>
        The name mie kocok roughly translates as shaken noodles, presumably because the noodles are shaken in a strainer before they are added to the soup.</p>

      <h3>Bajigur</h3>
      <p>Bajigur is a hot drink, native to the Sundanese people of West Java, Indonesia. Full of sweet and spicy flavors of ginger, aren sugar, and coconut milk, 
        this beverage is most commonly paired with traditional snacks such as steamed bananas, boiled peanuts or boiled sweet potato.<br>
        Bajigur is sold through mobile vendor carts equipped with stoves that keep the drink hot and is considered best suited for drinking during cold nights, 
        rainy days or when spending time in cool highlands.</p>
