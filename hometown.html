      <p>Paris van Java is not a made-up slogan coined by the local government to boost tourism. In fact, the nickname was made popular
        almost a century ago during the colonial era. Some traced the moniker to a Dutch businessman who first invented the term to help
        market his goods. Paris van Java was then learned and repeated by others, including European tourists who witness the city’s
        sophistication.</p>
      <p>During the early 1900s, most buildings in Bandung were built with Art Deco as an architectural reference. These buildings include
        the popular Savoy Homann Hotel and the iconic De Vries Building, which was the city’s first department store. Beyond Art Deco,
        most heritage buildings in Bandung reflect European influences in architecture, including the neoclassical or even Gothic style.</p>
      <p>The easiest way to enjoy Bandung’s distinctive and decorative architecture is to stroll by Braga Street, which was one of the old 
        city’s centers of civilization. Many buildings on that street are closed for business or have been repurposed, but their facade is 
        still astonishing to observe.</p>
      <p>Preceding Bandung’s thriving art and culture scene is its glorious natural landscape. It has a mountainous topography that gives
        the city stunning natural scenery and much cooler weather, compared with other cities in Java, Indonesia. Those natural and
        geographical attributes were what first drew the Dutch colonists to the city and made them decide to build and develop it. The
        cooler climate was deemed more suitable for Europeans.</p>
